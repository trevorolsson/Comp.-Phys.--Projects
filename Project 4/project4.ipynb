    "## Objective:\n",
    "A mass is attached to a spring and is allowed to oscillate. There is a drag on the system such that the mass ceases its oscillation after a while. We can model this as a second order, linear ODE\n",

    "1. Solve the system using a self-built fourth-order Rugge-Kutta method\n",
    "    1. Let $m=4, c=2, k=16$, initial condition $x(0)=2$ and boundary condition $\\frac{dx}{dt}|_{t=0}=30$ in the range $0<t<20$.\n",

    "2. Give the final $\\Delta t$ used and list the calculated $x$ at $t=1,2,3, ..., 20$ for six decimal places.\n",
